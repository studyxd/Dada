<title>Dada Privacy Policy</title></head>
<body><h1><strong>Privacy Policy</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>Effective Date: June 16, 2025</strong></h2>
<p>At PT PACIFIC BYTE DYNAMICS (&quot;Dada&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, or &quot;us&quot;), your privacy is our priority. This Privacy Policy describes our approach to handling personal information collected when you interact with the Dada app, our website, or any services we provide (collectively, the “Dada Services”).</p>
<p>As a user of Dada, you may provide us with certain personal information during your interactions with our services—whether you&#39;re registering an account, updating your profile, going live, joining chats, following creators, or subscribing to channels.</p>
<p>Please note that some aspects of the Dada platform are inherently social. This means the information you choose to share—such as your username, broadcasts, comments, or engagement—may be visible to other users or the public, depending on your privacy settings.</p>
<p>Dada also enables interactive features that display elements of user activity, such as identifying who posted particular content, or showing who has joined or followed a stream. These features are designed to enhance engagement but may involve public exposure of some data.</p>
<p>We encourage all users to take full advantage of our privacy controls and to be thoughtful when deciding what to share on Dada.</p>

<h2><strong>Types of Information We Collect</strong></h2>
<p>To operate the Dada platform efficiently and responsibly, we collect personal information through both direct input from users and automated technical processes. This section outlines the kinds of data we may gather:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Information You Provide Directly</strong></h3>
<p>You may share personal details with us when you:</p>
<p>• Create or update your Dada account</p>
<p>• Upload profile images, stream content, or send messages</p>
<p>• Participate in interactive features (e.g., comments, gifts, reactions)</p>
<p>• Contact customer service or take part in surveys or promotions</p>
<p>This may include your username, profile photo, contact information (email, phone number), self-introduction, educational or professional background, and user-generated content (UGC) like text, audio, video, or images.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Information Collected Automatically</strong></h3>
<p>When you use Dada Services, we may automatically collect technical and behavioral information for purposes such as functionality, safety, and analytics. This may include:</p>
<p>• Device information (model, OS version, unique device identifiers)</p>
<p>• IP address and browser type</p>
<p>• App usage data (features clicked, time spent, crash logs)</p>
<p>• Location data (when enabled)</p>
<p>• Metadata related to your uploads, such as hashtags or timestamps</p>
<h3><strong>3. Information from Linked Services (if authorized)</strong></h3>
<p>If you connect your Dada account to a third-party service (such as Facebook, Google, or Apple), we may receive relevant account information as permitted by your privacy settings on that platform.</p>
<h2><strong>How Your Data Is Utilized</strong></h2>
<p>We use the information we collect to provide, optimize, and secure the Dada Services. The ways in which your data is used include, but are not limited to, the following purposes:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Service Delivery and Feature Enablement</strong></h3>
<p>To operate essential platform functions such as account registration, profile personalization, livestream broadcasting, content sharing, friend discovery, and payment processing.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Platform Enhancement</strong></h3>
<p>To understand usage behavior, diagnose bugs, and develop new features that improve user experience and engagement across different regions and devices.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Communication and Notifications</strong></h3>
<p>To send you relevant updates, service alerts, promotional content, or responses to your inquiries through in-app messages, email, or other communication channels you permit.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Safety, Trust, and Moderation</strong></h3>
<p>To detect suspicious activity, prevent fraud or abuse, enforce community rules, and take action against content or behavior that violates our standards or local laws.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Personalization and Recommendations</strong></h3>
<p>To offer you tailored content, interactive features, and user suggestions based on your preferences, past activity, or geographic region.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Legal Compliance and Risk Management</strong></h3>
<p>To meet legal obligations under applicable data protection laws, support regulatory audits, and respond to official requests from government or law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>We always aim to use your data in a way that is relevant, limited, and aligned with your expectations.</p>
<h3><strong>Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies</strong></h3>
<p>To enhance your experience and improve our services, Dada and our authorized partners utilize cookies and related tracking technologies (such as pixel tags, local storage objects, and web beacons) throughout the platform.</p>
<p>Cookies are small data files stored on your device that enable core platform features, remember your preferences, and help us understand how you interact with the app. Web beacons (also known as “clear GIFs” or “tracking pixels”) are tiny graphics embedded in pages or messages that allow us to monitor activities such as page visits and email engagement.</p>
<p>By using the Dada platform, you agree to our use of these technologies.</p>
<p>We may link data collected via cookies to your email address, login credentials, or device ID to better associate your activity across sessions and devices.</p>
<p>Please note that third-party services integrated with Dada may apply their own cookie and privacy practices. Dada is not responsible for how such third parties collect or use your information, and this Privacy Policy does not govern their actions.</p>
<p>You have control over your cookie settings. Most browsers allow you to block or delete cookies. Please refer to your browser’s instructions to manage these preferences. Keep in mind that disabling certain cookies may limit some features or performance of our platform.</p>
<p>Depending on the purpose of processing, we may rely on more than one legal basis for using your personal data (such as your consent, contract necessity, or legitimate interest), in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
<h2><strong>When and Why We Share Data</strong></h2>
<p>Dada does not sell your personal information. However, in specific circumstances, we may share certain data with trusted third parties to ensure smooth service operations, compliance, and user protection. These cases include:</p>
<h3><strong>1. With Your Consent</strong></h3>
<p>We may share your data with third-party services (such as social media platforms) when you link your Dada account or explicitly authorize the connection.</p>
<h3><strong>2. With Service Providers</strong></h3>
<p>We engage external vendors to perform functions on our behalf—such as cloud storage, payment processing, analytics, content moderation, and customer support. These partners may access limited personal data only to the extent required for their tasks, and they are contractually bound to safeguard your information.</p>
<h3><strong>3. For Legal or Regulatory Reasons</strong></h3>
<p>We may disclose data when required by law or legal process (e.g., court order, government request), or to protect the rights, safety, or property of Dada, its users, or the public.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Business Transfers</strong></h3>
<p>In the event of a company merger, acquisition, restructuring, or asset sale, user data may be transferred as part of that transaction, subject to the same level of protection outlined in this policy.</p>
<h3><strong>5. To Enforce Our Policies</strong></h3>
<p>We may share information to investigate potential violations of our Terms of Service, address security issues, or prevent abusive or harmful behavior.</p>
<p>We will never share your personal data in ways that conflict with your privacy settings or violate applicable data protection laws.</p>
<h2><strong>Transfers of Data Across Borders</strong></h2>
<p>As a global platform, Dada may process your personal information on servers located outside of your country or region of residence. These international transfers are necessary for delivering core platform services, maintaining infrastructure, and providing seamless user experiences across geographies.</p>
<p>We take appropriate steps to ensure that any cross-border transfer of personal data is done securely and in compliance with applicable data protection laws. These steps include:</p>
<p>• <strong>Using Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)</strong> where required under relevant laws (e.g., GDPR);</p>
<p>• <strong>Partnering only with third-party vendors</strong> who implement comparable data security standards;</p>
<p>• <strong>Minimizing data transfers</strong> to the extent necessary for operations;</p>
<p>• <strong>Encrypting sensitive information</strong> during transmission and storage.</p>
<p>By using Dada Services, you understand and agree that your data may be processed in jurisdictions that may have different data protection standards than those in your home country. However, we will continue to safeguard your personal data to a level consistent with this policy.</p>
<h2><strong>External Links and Third-Party Content</strong></h2>
<p>The Dada platform may include links to websites, mobile apps, or content provided by third parties. These external platforms are not owned or controlled by Dada, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such third-party services.</p>
<p>When you choose to interact with content, tools, or services that are not hosted on Dada (e.g., external websites, embedded social media, or third-party payment gateways), your activity may be governed by their own terms and privacy policies.</p>
<p>We strongly recommend that you review the privacy policies of any external service before sharing personal information or engaging with their features.</p>
<p>Your use of third-party content or services is solely at your own discretion and risk.</p>
<h2><strong>Keeping Your Information Secure</strong></h2>
<p>We take the protection of your personal data seriously. Dada implements a combination of technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to reduce the risk of unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure of your information.</p>
<p>Our security measures include:</p>
<p>• Data encryption during transmission and storage</p>
<p>• Access controls and role-based permission systems</p>
<p>• Secure server infrastructure and firewalls</p>
<p>• Regular system audits and security assessments</p>
<p>• Employee training and confidentiality agreements</p>
<p>While we strive to protect your data using industry-standard practices, no method of transmission or storage is completely foolproof. We encourage you to take precautions, such as using a strong password and keeping your login credentials private.</p>
<p>If you believe your Dada account or information has been compromised, please contact us immediately at service@dada.fans.</p>
<h2><strong>Your Data Preferences and Controls</strong></h2>
<p>We believe you should have control over how your personal information is used. Dada provides a range of settings and tools that allow you to manage your data preferences in a way that suits your comfort level and privacy needs.</p>

<h2><strong>Privacy of Underage Users</strong></h2>
<p>Dada is intended for users who are 18 years of age or older. We do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal information from individuals under the minimum age requirement defined by local law.</p>
<p>If we become aware that we have unintentionally gathered personal data from a user who does not meet the minimum age threshold, we will take steps to delete that information as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>To help protect minors, we offer users and guardians the ability to report inappropriate content or accounts suspected of being operated by underage individuals. Such reports can be submitted via the in-app reporting tool or by emailing service@dada.fans.</p>
<p>If you are a parent or legal guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal data without your consent, please contact us so we can take corrective action.</p>
<h2><strong>User Content and Platform Integrity</strong></h2>
<p>Dada provides an interactive space where users can create and share a variety of content. We support creative expression while maintaining a safe, respectful environment for all users.</p>
<h2><strong>Content You Can Share</strong></h2>

You may also enhance your content using features made available by Dada, such as digital effects, sound filters, stickers, and virtual items.</p>
<p>Please note that content shared on Dada reflects the views of individual users, and does not represent the official views of Dada or its affiliates.</p>
<h2><strong>How We Manage Content and Behavior</strong></h2>
<p>To protect the safety and integrity of our platform, we actively monitor for violations of our content standards and community rules. This is done through a combination of automated systems, user reports, and moderation teams.</p>
<p>If we detect content or actions that violate our guidelines—including but not limited to harmful behavior, abuse, or illegal activity—we may take steps such as:</p>
<p>• Removing the offending content</p>
<p>• Restricting certain features or account visibility</p>
<p>• Temporarily or permanently suspending the account</p>
<p>• Reporting to relevant law enforcement or regulatory bodies if necessary</p>
<p>We reserve the right to enforce these actions at our discretion to ensure a positive and compliant user environment.</p>
<h2><strong>How Long We Keep Your Data</strong></h2>
<p>We retain your personal information only for as long as it is necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>

<p><strong>• Anonymized or Aggregated Data:</strong> We may retain anonymized or aggregated data that no longer identifies you personally for analytics or research purposes.</p>
<p>If your account has been deactivated due to policy violations, we may retain certain identifiers to prevent abuse and maintain platform integrity.</p>
<h2><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our services, legal obligations, or operational practices.</p>
